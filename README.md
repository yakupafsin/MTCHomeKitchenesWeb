This is the web version of my Expo app. You can run this app in your web browser to experience its features. Below are the steps to get it up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) - Install the Expo CLI globally using npm or yarn.

## Getting Started
